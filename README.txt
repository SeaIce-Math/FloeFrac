The codes in this repository can be used to create data banks in
'Phase-field models of floe fracture in sea ice' by
H. Dinh, D. Giannakis, J. Slawinska and G. Stadler, 2022

The files include:

linFieldGen.py--creates scalar fields that model linear weaknesses
fractureDemoLinearWeakZones.py--simulates fracture with a linear weakness on 1 km^2 domain
fractureDemo.py--simulates fracture on 1 km^2 domain without weaknesses

These codes require the FEniCS library that may be installed using the instructions 
found at the link below.

These codes ran under the following versions of the software libraries:

FEniCS version: 2019.1.0
mshr version:  2019.1.0
